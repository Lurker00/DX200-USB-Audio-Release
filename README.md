# DX200 USB Audio
This application turns iBasso DX200 audio part into a USB DAC, accessible for Android applications. When it starts the USB DAC Interface, then any Android music player application that supports and is configured to use a USB DAC will play bit perfect audio, including DSD! For DSD, it supports both Native and DoP modes, and even DoP-encoded PCM formats, e.g. in flac.

**Please note:** such applications are not aware that the volume control of DX200 _is the volume control_ of the USB DAC they use! It may lead to distorted, or too loud sound! Look into the particular application setting to find a way to disable using volume control at all.

**Warning:** Avoid having installed and configured for USB DAC playback more than one application at a time! They tend to autolaunch on a device attached, and you\'ll have a mess, that may lead to conflicting system volume settings, that may damage your ears or headphones!
